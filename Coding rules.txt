XFTL Coding Rules
=================

This document describes the general rules of formatting code in XFTL as well as some coding guidelines.


Code formatting:
================
The XFTL project utilizes eclipse' built-in code formatting rules (Window->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter).

The most important points:
* curly braces in type and method declarations start on the same line as the declaration


Coding guidelines
=================
* fields start with an underscore (e.g. _name)
* constants are all upper case, underscores replace camel casing (e.g. SHIP_NAME)
* always include an else branch in switch bodies for easier debugging
* install eclipse' findbugs plugin!
* read Clean Code by Robert C. Martin!
* use unix line endings (\n)
* use UTF-8 encoding
